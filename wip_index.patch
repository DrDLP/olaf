-# Olaf
-
-Olaf is a Windows-first desktop application that helps automate a **video-ready visuals pipeline** for AI-generated songs (e.g. Suno).
-
-The goal is simple: start from a song (audio + optional cover + lyrics), then build and export a visual composition using:
-- **stem separation** (to route visuals to drums/bass/vocals)
-- **vocal/lyrics alignment** (word-level timings)
-- **3D audio-reactive visual plugins**
-- **2D cover effects chain** (audio-reactive post-processing / stylization)
-- **lyrics visuals** (karaoke / scroll / overlays)
-- **final export** to a rendered video
-
-> Olaf is a personal/experimental tool. Expect rough edges and hardware-dependent performance.
-
----
-
-## Platform support
-
-- **Primary target:** Windows
-- Other operating systems are **not thoroughly tested**.
-
----
-
-## Installation (Windows, automatic)
-
-Olaf ships with a bootstrap launcher that:
-- creates a local virtual environment (`.venv`)
-- installs dependencies
-- tries to install **torch + torchaudio** with CUDA wheels first (then falls back to CPU)
-- installs optional packages used by some visuals
-- installs **Demucs** (stems) and **openai-whisper** (alignment)
-- launches the GUI
-
-This behavior is implemented in `run_olaf.py`. 
-
-### Recommended way
-
-- Run `olaf.bat` (it activates `.venv` and starts Olaf). 
-
-### Alternative
-
-- Run:
-  - `python run_olaf.py`
-
-On first run, installation can take a while (downloads + wheels + models). 
-
----
-
-## Disk space (important)
-
-Plan for a **large installation (often > 12 GB)** due to ML/audio models and heavy dependencies.
-
----
-
-## Performance expectations (important)
-
-Rendering/export can be **very slow**, especially for **2D cover effect chains** (depending on resolution, FPS, effects, and hardware).
-
-**Strong recommendation:** export a short segment first (10–20 seconds) before committing to a full render.
-
----
-
-## What the app does (workflow)
-
-A typical workflow inside Olaf looks like:
-
-1. **Projects**
-   - create/select a project
-   - import the main audio track (+ optional cover image)
-
-2. **Stems (optional but recommended)**
-   - generate stems (e.g. drums/bass/vocals)
-   - use stems for better routing (cleaner beat/pulse triggers, etc.)
-
-3. **Vocal alignment**
-   - align lyrics to audio (word-level timings)
-   - review and manually adjust phrase/word timing when needed
-
-4. **Visuals**
-   - **3D visualizations:** configure audio-reactive 3D plugins and routing
-   - **2D cover visualizations:** build an ordered chain of cover effects and routing
-   - **Lyrics visuals:** choose a lyrics visualization plugin + style
-
-5. **Export**
-   - render the final video composition
-
----
-
-## Notes & tips
-
-- If you only need beat/pulse, routing to the **drums** stem often produces the most stable trigger.
-- If export is too slow, temporarily reduce:
-  - export resolution
-  - export FPS
-  - number of 2D effects (2D is frequently the slowest part)
-
----
-
-## Troubleshooting (high level)
-
-- If an effect/plugin does not render, verify that its optional dependencies installed successfully.
-- If stems/alignment features are missing, check installation logs: Demucs / Whisper are installed explicitly (without pulling torch again).
