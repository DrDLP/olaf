# Olaf documentation

Olaf is a Windows-first desktop application to help automate a video-ready visual pipeline for AI-generated songs (e.g. Suno).

It focuses on:
- project management (audio + optional cover)
- stem separation
- vocal/lyrics alignment (word-level timings)
- 3D visualization plugins (audio-reactive)
- 2D cover effects chain (audio-reactive)
- lyrics visuals (karaoke / scroll / overlays)
- export to a final video

## Platform support

Olaf is primarily designed for **Windows**.
Other operating systems have **not been thoroughly tested**.

## Installation size & disk space

Installation can be **large (often > 12 GB)** because it includes multiple ML/audio models and dependencies.

## Performance expectations

Rendering/export can be **very slow**, especially for **2D cover effects** (depending on resolution, FPS, effects, and hardware).
A recommended workflow is to export short segments first (10–20s) before committing to a full render.

## Getting started

- Follow the **Quickstart** page.
- Use the app tabs as a guided workflow: Projects → Stems → Vocal → Visuals → Export.
